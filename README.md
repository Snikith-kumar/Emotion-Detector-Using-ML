# Emotion-Detector-Using-ML
Real-time facial emotion recognition using OpenCV and Mini-XCEPTION
# Emotion Detector using Machine Learning 🎭

This project is a real-time facial emotion recognition system using OpenCV and a pre-trained Mini-XCEPTION model trained on the FER-2013 dataset. It detects faces from webcam input and classifies emotions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
